            This growth is promising for those looking to invest in the industry. A look at sales totals on EVs in the U.S., with Tesla’s four models dominating the top 10 list, can point you in the right direction. Especially after the stock’s split in August 2022, Tesla is one of the best values in EV stocks if you’re looking for a long-term investment.

            But there are many other EV stocks also showing promise right now – encompassing both domestic and international EV manufacturers and one conventional auto manufacturer heavily vested in EVs right now. We also included one EV ETF for more risk-averse investors seeking to invest in the EV market while maintaining a diversified portfolio.

            EV stocks are appealing for their growth potential, as well as to investors seeking to support sustainable companies. Stock investing should not be an emotional play, but it is fun to invest in brands you believe in and, in nearly every case, EV manufacturers are seeking to build a better, more eco-friendly world with their technology solutions.
